# iters-fn

This is the cool cousin of [iters.js](https://github.com/casperin/iters.js). Its functions are (for
the most part) curried, and the library includes a few additional functions, such as `eq`, `neq`,
`lt`, etc.

`reduce` is renamed and expanded to `foldl`, `foldl1`, `foldr`, and `foldr1`, and pretty much
emulates their namesakes over in haskell-land.

## Stuff you can do with this library

On the top of my head

* Infinite stuff
* Lazy evaluation on arrays and iterators
* Somewhat advanced composition and currying
* Your usual other stuff when it comes to operating on lists

## Future

I might (especially if you encourage me) expand it to work on Sets, Maps, and Objects as well, to
make it a full-blown utility belt kind of thing.
